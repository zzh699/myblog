title: Memerable CityU experience
---

Hi all. This is my first hand-written blog with `jekyll` and Github Pages. I found this way of writting blogs amazing from about a half year ago but just decided to give it the first try. Because I just picked up the essence of costomizing the website layout with jekyll.

I came to Hong Kong since 2013 to get my Masters degree in City University of Hong Kong. And I have indeed leart and grown a lot during that one year's study. Among all of experiences, the memory I kept about our library is noteworthy. I like to come here regardless of the weekends and holidays because I love the atomosphere, the equipments, the resources, the staffs, the smell and many..I always saw people come and go, come and go day by day since I was always the early one to arrive and the last one to leave. 

Of course, the main reason I like here is because the resources in our library are extremly catching and abuntant. No matter what I want to read, I can always get it. And they are always the most advanced and latest in the world, which also makes me excited.
